# Imaginarium Storyteller

A new Flutter project that brings magical stories to life for your little ones.

## About The Project

Imaginarium Storyteller is a mobile application designed to generate unique and engaging stories for children. The core idea is to provide a creative yet guided experience where users can craft stories starting from pre-configured prompts. These prompts can be customized by changing a few key words, similar to the background AI generation on a Pixel 8 Pro, ensuring the generated content remains within a safe and appropriate scope.

### Key Features

*   **Customizable Story Generation:** Create stories by customizing pre-built prompts.
*   **AI-Powered Illustrations:** Each page of the story will be accompanied by a beautiful, AI-generated background image to visually enhance the narrative. Initially, this will explore using services like Banana for image generation, with plans to integrate other models as they become available.
*   **Monetization & Sustainability:** To cover the costs of generative AI services, the free version of the app will include advertisements during the story creation process.
*   **Pro Plan:** A premium "Pro" subscription will be available, offering an ad-free experience and the ability to access and manage a library of previously created stories.

## Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** Flutter
*   **Language:** Dart
